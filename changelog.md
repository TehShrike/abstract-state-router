# [8.0.2](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router/releases/tag/v8.0.2)

- fix a bug where default parameters from parent states were being ignored [#169](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router/pull/169)
	- if you navigated to state1.child2.grandchild3, the only default parameters being used were the ones on grandchild3
- remove support for `defaultQuerystringParameters` in state definitions [#168](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router/pull/168)
	- technically this should be a breaking change, and I wish we'd remembered to do it during the 8.0.0 release, but I don't feel too bad about doing it now because
		- it was deprecated 8 years ago
		- the type definition doesn't include it, so anyone using TS is already guaranteed to not be using it
		- anyone continuing to use it will get a runtime warning in their console about it

# [8.0.1](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router/releases/tag/v8.0.1)

- Fix: pass the correct state name into `getDomChild` [#167](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router/pull/167)

# [8.0.0](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router/releases/tag/v8.0.0)

- drop callbacks, everything is promises now [#162](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router/pull/162)
- drop CJS, use ESM everywhere [#166](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router/pull/166)
- added TypeScript types

# [7.7.1](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router/releases/tag/v7.7.1)

- Fixed lying changelog

# [7.7.0](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router/releases/tag/v7.7.0)

- Accidentally published this new version because I wasn't paying attention to branch names when I merged a PR.  No real changes occurred

# [7.6.0](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router/releases/tag/v7.6.0)

- feature: the `canLeaveState` function now gets passed a second argument with the name+parameters of the state that the user is trying to navigate to
- technically a breaking change: the previously undocumented `stateChangePrevented` function now gets passed a name+parameters object as its first argument, instead of just the name of the current state.  Also, it gets passed a second argument with the name+parameters of the state that the user attempted to visit.

# [7.5.2](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router/releases/tag/v7.5.2)

Fix: only call `canLeaveState` on states that are going to be destroyed, not the ones that are going to get created.

# [7.5.1](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router/releases/tag/v7.5.1)

Fix a bug that could cause `canLeaveState` to be called twice.  [#155](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router/pull/155)

# [7.5.0](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router/releases/tag/v7.5.0)

Add `canLeaveState` to `addState`, so you can implement route guards to prevent people from navigating away from a state if they e.g. have unsaved state.  [#154](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router/pull/154)

# [7.4.0](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router/releases/tag/v7.4.0)

Support passing in a `null` state name to `stateIsActive`.

# [7.3.1](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router/releases/tag/v7.3.1)

Fixes an issue where when a state was destroyed and resolved during the same state change, the result of its `resolve` function would get tossed out.

# [7.3.0](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router/releases/tag/v7.3.0)

Removes the concept of resetting states.  [#152](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router/pull/152)

The concept of resetting breaks down if your component library doesn't support
- slots
- resetting the state of a component without resetting the contents of slots

For renderers that "reset" states by destroying the existing component and re-constructing it, stuff would break in any case where a parent and child state were both told to reset at once.  Whenever the parent would reset and destroy its part of the DOM, the child would get wiped out.

Existing renderers don't need to change to work with this version of ASR, it's just that their `reset` function won't get called any more.

The `beforeResetState` and `afterResetState` events should not be fired any more.

# [7.2.0](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router/releases/tag/v7.2.0)

- Coerce parameter values to strings for comparison in `stateIsActive` [#151](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router/pull/151)

# [7.1.0](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router/releases/tag/v7.1.0)

- Give an explicit/useful error message if you forget to add a `ui-view` element to a parent template [#148](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router/pull/148)

# [7.0.0](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router/releases/tag/v7.0.0)

- maintenance: update a bunch of dependencies [#141](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router/pull/141)
- maintenance: autoformat the scripts to make myself feel better and reduce commit noise in the future [#145](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router/pull/145)
- breaking: dropped ES5 support.  If you're targeting ES5 you'll need to compile it in your own app's build.

# [6.2.0](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router/releases/tag/v6.2.0)

- feature: allow dynamic parameter defaults via functions [#144](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router/pull/144)

# [6.0.4](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router/releases/tag/v6.0.4)

- bug fix: update the hash-brown-router dependency to fix an issue where calling `evaluateCurrent('somestate')` wouldn't do anything when `somestate`'s route was `/` and the current url was also `/`.  Issue #116 in abstract-state-router, commit [#56c207f0](https://github.com/TehShrike/hash-brown-router/commit/56c207f011600722f2a805f88ab2381eb55fde2f) in hash-brown-router.  If you're passing in your own hash-brown-router instance, make sure to update it to 3.3.1 to avoid the bug.

# [6.0.3](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router/releases/tag/v6.0.3)

- bug fix: point package.main at the ES5 bundle instead of the ES2015 code :-x [34ea0baa](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router/commit/34ea0baa3286affed51d1a493aeedbb5b40819ae)

# [5.17.0](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router/releases/tag/v5.17.0)

- functional: `stateChangeStart` and `stateChangeEnd` events now also emit the full array of states being transitioned to. [#113](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router/pull/113)

# [5.14.0](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router/releases/tag/v5.14.0)

- functional: replaced the `defaultQuerystringParameters` property on states with `defaultParameters`, which applies to both querystring and route parameters.  If you don't specify `defaultParameters`, `defaultQuerystringParameters` will be checked too (though it will now apply to route parameters as well).  [#91](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router/issues/91)
